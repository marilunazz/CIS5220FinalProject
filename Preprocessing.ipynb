this has something to do with parameter sniffing, but i am just perplexed at how something like the following example is even possible with a piece of technology that does so many complex things well.  many of us have run into stored procedures that intermittently run several of orders of magnitude slower than usual, and then if you copy out the sql from the procedure and use the same parameter values in a separate query window, it runs as fast as usual.  i just fixed a procedure like that by converting this:  alter procedure p_myproc (     @param1 int ) as -- do a complex query with @param1   to this:  alter procedure p_myproc (     @param1 int ) as  declare @param1copy int; set @param1copy = @param1;  -- do the query using @param1copy   it went from running in over a minute back down to under one second, like it usually runs.  this behavior seems totally random.  for 9 out of 10 @param1 inputs, the query is fast, regardless of how much data it ends up needing to crunch, or how big the result set it.  but for that 1 out of 10, it just gets lost.  and the fix is to replace an int with the same int in the query?  it makes no sense.  [edit]  @gbn linked to this question, which details a similar problem:    i hesitate to cry \"bug!\" because that is so often a cop-out, but this really does seem like a bug to me.  when i run the two versions of my stored procedure with the same input, i see identical query plans.  the only difference is that the original takes more than a minute to run, and the version with the goofy parameter copying runs instantly. \n","1 rendering html with the htmltextwriter is not incredibly intuitive in my opinion, but if you are implementing web controls in web forms it is what you have to work with. i thought that it might be possible to create a fluent interface for this that reads a bit more like the html it outputs. i would like to know what people think of the syntax that i have come up with so far.      public void render(htmltextwriter writer)     {         writer             .tag(htmltextwritertag.div, e =&gt; e[htmltextwriterattribute.id, \"id\"][htmltextwriterattribute.name,\"name\"][htmltextwriterattribute.class,\"class\"])                 .tag(htmltextwritertag.span)                     .text(\"lorem\")                 .endtag()                 .tag(htmltextwritertag.span)                     .text(\"ipsum\")                 .endtag()             .endtag();             }   \"tag\", \"text\" and \"endtag\" are extension methods for the htmltextwriter class that returns the instance it takes in so that calls can be chained. the argument passed to the lambda used in the overload used by the first call to \"tag\" is a \"htmlattributemanager\", which is simple class that wraps an htmltextwriter to provide an indexer that takes an htmltextwriterattribute and a string value and returns the instance so that calls can be chained. i also have methods on this class for the most common attributes, such as \"name\", \"class\" and \"id\" so that you could write the first call above as follows:  .tag(htmltextwritertag.div, e =&gt; e.id(\"id\").name(\"name\").class(\"class\"))   a little longer example:  public void render(htmltextwriter writer) {     writer         .tag(htmltextwritertag.div, a =&gt; a.class(\"someclass\", \"someotherclass\"))             .tag(htmltextwritertag.h1).text(\"lorem\").endtag()             .tag(htmltextwritertag.select, t =&gt; t.id(\"fooselect\").name(\"fooselect\").class(\"selectclass\"))                 .tag(htmltextwritertag.option, t =&gt; t[htmltextwriterattribute.value, \"1\"][htmltextwriterattribute.title, \"selects the number 1.\"])                     .text(\"1\")                 .endtag(htmltextwritertag.option)                 .tag(htmltextwritertag.option, t =&gt; t[htmltextwriterattribute.value, \"2\"][htmltextwriterattribute.title, \"selects the number 2.\"])                     .text(\"2\")                 .endtag(htmltextwritertag.option)                 .tag(htmltextwritertag.option, t =&gt; t[htmltextwriterattribute.value, \"3\"][htmltextwriterattribute.title, \"selects the number 3.\"])                     .text(\"3\")                 .endtag(htmltextwritertag.option)             .endtag(htmltextwritertag.select)         .endtag(htmltextwritertag.div); }   hopefully you will be able to \"decipher\" what html this snippet outputs, at least that is the idea.  please give me any thoughts on how the syntax can be improved upon, maybe better method names, maybe some other approach all together.  edit: i thought it might be interesting to see what the same snippet would look like without the use of the fluent interface, for comparison:  public void renderusinghtmltextwriterstandardmethods(htmltextwriter writer) {     writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.class, \"someclass someotherclass\");     writer.renderbegintag(htmltextwritertag.div);      writer.renderbegintag(htmltextwritertag.h1);     writer.write(\"lorem\");     writer.renderendtag();      writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.id, \"fooselect\");     writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.name, \"fooselect\");     writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.class, \"selectclass\");     writer.renderbegintag(htmltextwritertag.select);      writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.value, \"1\");     writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.title, \"selects the number 1.\");     writer.renderbegintag(htmltextwritertag.option);     writer.write(\"1\");     writer.renderendtag();      writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.value, \"2\");     writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.title, \"selects the number 2.\");     writer.renderbegintag(htmltextwritertag.option);     writer.write(\"2\");     writer.renderendtag();      writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.value, \"3\");     writer.addattribute(htmltextwriterattribute.title, \"selects the number 3.\");     writer.renderbegintag(htmltextwritertag.option);     writer.write(\"3\");     writer.renderendtag();      writer.renderendtag();      writer.renderendtag(); }   edit: i should probably be a little more explicit in that one of the goals with this is that it should incur as little overhead as possible, this is why i have limited the use of lambdas. also at first i used a class that represented a tag so that something similar to a dom-tree was built by the syntax before the rendering, the syntax was very similar though. i abandoned this solution for the slight memory overhead it incurs. there are still some of this present in the use of the htmlattributemanager class, i have been thinking about using extension methods for the appending of attributes also, but the i cannot use the indexer-syntax, also it bloats the interface of the htmltextwriter even more. \n","2 quick question: what is the compiler flag to allow g++ to spawn multiple instances of itself in order to compile large projects quicker (for example 4 source files at
